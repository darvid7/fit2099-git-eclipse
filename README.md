# Importing & running your project using git and Eclipse.

A few students have had problems when trying to import a project from git.

I've seen this pop up a few times.

Here is a workaround.

1. Go to file > import > git > projects from git and enter your gitlab url & authentication details

2. Click next twice and select where to store your project, remember this location.

In this case it is `/Users/David/git/starwarsassignments-my-assignment-here`

4. Select Java Project, click next, untick use default location and navigate to your project 

Make sure to untick `Use default location` and select `Browse` and navigate to where you selected to store your project.
